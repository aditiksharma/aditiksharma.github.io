							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I gained valuable insights from the article "More Padding, Please! The power of white space in product design." This article underscored the importance of white space in product design, emphasizing that it is more than just empty space. White space serves as a critical design element that enhances visual clarity, maintains balance, and directs user attention effectively. The article also highlights how product designers often request specific padding to achieve intentional design effects, and it dispels the misconception that white space is wasted space, emphasizing its role in improving user experience and readability.
