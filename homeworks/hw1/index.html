            Hi! My name is Aditi Sharma. I love to dance, sing, play my guitar, write songs, and explore new places. One fun fact about me is that I have a streak of over 400 days on Duolingo (I'm learning French).
            My favorite places to eat around campus are:
            <ul> 
                <li>Toss Noodle Bar</li>
                <li>Imm Thai</li>
                <li>Slivers</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

                        Something I learned from this article was the four things to keep in mind when designing a website. 
                        These things are: Hierarchy, Content, Intent, and Audience. Each is key in the marketing and retention rates of websites.

                       My favorite part of the article was the observations of different apps and websites and how each item that is shown on screen was given a clera purpose. I dont think I ever realized how much of an impact these small things made on the way people amsorb content.
